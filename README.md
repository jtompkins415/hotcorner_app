# REQUIREMENTS

## Requirements Gathering

Begin by gathering detailed requirements from the restaurant owners and staff. Identify the specific features and functionalities they need, including POS capabilities, reservation management, reporting, and any other custom requirements.

## Database Design

Design the database schema to store information such as menu items, tables, reservations, orders, and customer data. Use a relational database like Microsoft SQL Server for data storage.

## User Roles and Authentication

Define user roles (admin, staff, customer) and implement user authentication and authorization. Use ASP.NET Identity or a similar system for user management.

## Front-end Development

Create the user interfaces for both the POS system and the reservation platform. Use ASP.NET Razor Pages or MVC for server-side rendering or a JavaScript framework like React or Angular for a more dynamic front end.

## POS Functionality

Implement features like order creation, menu item management, table assignments, order processing, and payment processing. Integrate with hardware such as barcode scanners, receipt printers, and card readers if necessary.

## Reservation System

Develop reservation features including reservation creation, availability management, and confirmation. Provide customers with a user-friendly interface for making reservations online.

## Order Processing

Implement the workflow for processing orders and managing order status (e.g., kitchen prep, served, billed). Allow staff to easily modify orders and send them to the kitchen.

## Reporting and Analytics

Develop reporting tools to generate sales reports, inventory tracking, and reservation analytics. Use tools like SQL Reporting Services or third-party reporting libraries.

## Payment Processing

Integrate with payment gateways to handle credit card payments securely. Implement features like splitting bills, printing receipts, and handling cash payments.

## Inventory & Invoice Management

Track inventory levels for menu items and trigger alerts for low stock. Automate reordering processes for items in low supply.

## Security and Compliance

Ensure the application complies with security standards and regulations, especially for payment processing and customer data. Implement encryption, secure coding practices, and regular security audits.

## Scalability and Performance

Design the application to handle high loads during peak restaurant hours. Consider load balancing, caching, and database optimization.

## Integration with External Services

Integrate with third-party services for things like online reservations, customer reviews, and loyalty programs.

## Testing

Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure the application works as expected.

## Deployment

Deploy the application on a secure and scalable hosting environment. Use services like Azure App Service or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting.

## Maintenance and Support

Provide ongoing maintenance and support to address issues and make enhancements based on user feedback.

## Training and Documentation

Train restaurant staff on how to use the system. Provide documentation and support materials.

## Feedback and Iteration

Collect feedback from restaurant owners, staff, and customers to make continuous improvements to the system.
